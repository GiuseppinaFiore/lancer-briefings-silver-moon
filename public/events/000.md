The orbit-to-surface deployment of UNS-CV Rio Grande Mechanized Cavalry Squad B has gone awry, with it's dropship having been shot down by an unknown energy weapon. The squad's mechs are on their own in unfamiliar territory as they make their way to FOB Saber through the besieged city.

The dropship's crashlanding attracted several of the Vestan Sovereignty's forces to it's location, who immediately opened fire against the squad. 

## Further information pending. . .
