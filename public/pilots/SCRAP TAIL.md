Crushing defeat. One tail.

Inscrutable loss. Two tails.

A choice to let go. Three tails.

One who has forgotten. Four tails.

The path to the mountain. Five tails.

It's still the first step. Six tails.

Halfway to rebirth. The loop of suffering is closed. Don't forget this feeling in your fist.

Bred as a living weapon amongst many others, Scrap Tail fought and killed, fought and killed, fought and killed. Without knowing defeat, she slaughtered as she was bred to. A near-fatal loss destroyed that life. The sole survivor of her squad of genetic twins, she was shaken to the core, and ran. She ran, and ran, and ran, until she couldn't anymore, and did what she was born to do so she would run no more. Having had enough of this life, she chose to don her fox mask as a disguise, and took up her tail to remember her fallen sisters. Erasing her memory, she took the name Dust, and began contracting herself to try and make a right and just difference as callsign Scrap Tail. All she remembers is this feeling in her fist, the joy of the fight, and that the tails mean loss. Six tails fan out behind her.

"Come on. Let's find out how strong scrap can be."
