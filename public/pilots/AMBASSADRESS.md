Fourth Generation Sparii, Alice's great-grandparents made the poor decision to make landfall shortly before Asclepius Prime's ailing government was couped by burgeoning facist movement, isolating the planet from the developing shipping lanes beginning to form in the Asclepius System.

At four years old, Alice's parents "disappeared" shortly after the first edict from a newly crowned Overtyrant put a target on the backs of those not of "true Asclepian blood", absurdly vague a concept though it was. It wasn't long before she found herself running with other scrap-kids, eking out survival in the collosal scrapyards generated after years of continental conquest and failed uprisings.

By fifteen, Alice was an accomplished scavenger in a group of accomplished scavengers, dipping back into the increasingly martially-held streets of the capitol to sell salvaged materials, and bring resources back to the dens of the junkyards.

A year later, during one of Asclepius' worst winters on record, the First Liberators arrived. Clad in suits of burgundy and black, wielding weaponry that put the Overtyrant's chassis-corps to shame, they put boots-on-ground in several of the smaller cities surrounding the capitol. Unfortunately, the fervour that an isolated world can whip up with over 100 years of propaganda couldn't be underestimated, dragging a simple shock and awe liberation into 27 months of brutal inch by inch fighting.
On the dawn of the 28th month of the war, the forces of the Armoury left. Mission debriefing in sealed folders behind closed doors would be found to state that the extended zealous fighting from the Overtyrant's armies, alongside the masses being whipped into militia factions by the propaganda, had left the strategic and resource value of Asclepius Prime a non-viable target on this fringe edge of the expansion efforts.


The Capitol Palace had been leveled four months prior. The government of the Overtyrant had collapsed three before that.
It was a decade before the Third Committee arrived.



Alice had nothing left to stay for. Everyone she had known and protected had either died fighting against the "Alien Invaders" from above, perished in Armoury led uprisings, or simply disappeared in the years long winter that followed the "Liberation Effort".

Embittered by what she had seen, and what she had lived through, Alice vowed never to let it happened to anyone else. Anywhere else.



"It would be ideal not to deploy Pilot Rosenow [Callsign: Ambassadress, Operating Number: 882190E] into theatres relevant to Ras Shamra's interests. Though she said she would remain impartial and professional if that was the case during our initial interviews, her knuckles were white with tension as she did. Suggesting re-assignment to the engineering hangars during such operations if possible" - DOJ/HR Liaso
